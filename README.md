# --- Brick Breaker Pong_game ----
## -About my project-
This project is about a classic pong game rewrite with python.turtle method, but there's some extra features, which our classic one don't have.
First, for every 5 times the ball bounces will randomly create a new brick at random location, but not any location of the map(mostly because if it spawns too low it will be impossible to hit/reflect sometimes)

Second, when playing, the ball speed will keep increasing bit by bit to increase difficulty, when the stage is cleared the speed will be reduced to the base speed of the new level.

This game also saves your highest scores, in case you want to know what's you best play too.
