# --- Brick Breaker Pong_game ---
## - About my project -
This project is about a classic pong game rewrite with python.turtle method, but there's some extra features, which our classic one don't have.

First, for every 5 times the ball bounces will randomly create a new brick at random location, but not any location of the map(mostly because if it spawns too low it will be impossible to hit/reflect sometimes).

Second, when playing, the ball speed will keep increasing bit by bit to increase difficulty, when the stage is cleared the speed will be reduced to the base speed of the new level.

This game also saves your highest scores, in case you want to know what's your best play too.

## - How to install/run -
1. Fork this repo to your github 
2. Clone it to your pc folder
3. Open the folder and click "run_ball.py" file
4. Have fun!
 
## - Usage -
To interact with this game. On your keyboard, use Left and Right keys to move left and move right in game.

The expect output should be the ball moving around , and when it hits the wall/paddle or bricks it should bounce 90 degrees back. 

Sadly I wasn't able to implement the inelastic collision, so sometimes the ball could potentially get stuck in a loop but I've already made a way to fix that in the game already 
so no worries!

Here's a link to how to start the game and play it.
